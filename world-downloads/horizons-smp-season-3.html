                "so i joined about halfway through season 3 i believe, maybe a little earlier, maybe a little later. name and i decided to stick together (cause we're siblings so we're awesome), so we built a tower west of what was left of gleaps's windmill. 
                the first people we really encountered on the server were crafter, lentic, and jako. crafter asked name and i if we wanted to join the united restoration, and they sounded like they were the supposed “good guys” so we thought, why not?
                well, uh, two days after that, crafter burned down our tower where we lived. so that wasn't ideal.
                name and i decided to move away from spawn area, so hopefully this wouldn't happen again.
                by this point, we'd already met a bunch of people on the server, and started to become good friends with them. and because of me joking around with them, i may have had a part in cable and crafter getting “engaged” to one another. whoops.
                so the day of the wedding rolls around, and, well, no marriages ended up happening. just a big explosion and cable's death. (cause crafter is emo)
                oh, and turns out the crafter here isn't actually crafter, but a robot? so there's that. and because of jakovitch somehow hacking into crafter's hardware, he had some control over crafter.
                and i build the church of project a52!! all praise him 
                oh and uh apparently the old jako with the mask is my father?? idk how that happened to be honest                  then an awkward thing happens.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                crafter blows up the new house name and i made. and he says that jako told him to do it? and jako says he didn't? i'm still not really sure what happened there. but anyways, that's house #2 gone.
                and crafter kills my first and only dog, poodog :(
                so name and i move really really far away from spawn! and start on house #3.
                crafter finds it (again), but this time xoliks comes to the rescue! well, kinda. he says he wants to initiate a plan that crafterbot has, one to travel back in time. problem with that is, is that it needs a really strong power source to make it work. another awkward moment happens - crafter says my soul will be enough to power the time travel lolll so soulless nona enters the stage!
                later on, after xoliks and i have both logged off, jako finds and kills crafterbot. and that makes him really angry. and so crafter burns down house #3. wooo.
                at this point i'm kinda tired of my houses being destroyed, so jako, name, and i decide to form pirate island!! and it was awesome.
                later on, lentic, xoliks, feldragon, and toxic joined pirate island too! it was a party tbh
                but, uh, remember that time travel thing i was talking about earlier? so, something went wrong, and now the season 1 crafter is in season 3 instead of crafterbot. 
                so season 1 crafter is here, but he's also partially controlled by a different crafter? i'm not really sure, but he was deffo evil sometimes. but sometimes he was nice, and gave me my soul back (somehow)! :D
                a bit of time passes, and crafter is really angry with jako for some stuff that happened earlier in s3, before i showed up. long story short, crafter blows up pirate island. 
                and so i'm like “no this sucks” cause i'm so emotionally damaged. and since my soul is the thing that lets me feel emotions, i give it to lentic lol
