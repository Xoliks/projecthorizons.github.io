                "My teammates, Gleaps and Novel, gathered some starting materials and made a base in an iceberg. in the beginning there were three distinct teams my team, Nona and Jako's team and Cable's team. Cable and I were on good terms and frequently traded with each other, and built the enderman farm together. I gave him an elytra as trade for an unlimited supply of enchanted books. Eventually I found Jako and Nona's base and killed the "Xoliks Sheep" and later stole it's corpse, Which I later traded back in return for a slime farm (which didn't ever actually work). Name accidentally spilled the location of Cable's base so I went and stole from him. this ended up with me dying four times and becoming enemies with Cable. A new player joined the server and found my team's base so we had to move, but they turned out to be cheating so they were banned, which resulted in us having two bases. which was useful because Name, Nona, Jako, Fungi, and Kaladin joined joined our team. But novel and I decided to tell them our iceberg base was our only actual base.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                They all signed contracts saying that I would own their soul when they died. I also gave Name, Nona, And Jako an elytra when they joined. Nona died and lost hers, Cable killed Name and took their's. Wanting to get more elytras I flew over the entire end to find the rest of the remaining elytras. There turned out to be 13 elytras total and my team had eight of them. Three of them had already been lost. Cable was getting desperate to find my base so he reached out to Fungi and asked for base coordinates in return for an elytra. Fungi told the team what cable wanted and we decided to make a fake base to trick cable. Fungi got the elytra and I tried to kill cable in the fake base, But I failed, and Cable killed me instead. Some time passed and Cable tried again, This time reaching out to Novel with the same offer. Once again we made a fake base, but we had learned from last time and Cable had gotten even more powerful. We built this fake base right above bedrock and made a hole to bedrock right below the entrance to trap Cable in. Cable believed it again and gave Novel an elytra. The next day when i got online cable was already in the fake base he rushed to leave before he was spotted, but I saw him on his way out. So he decided to follow me in. I fell in first and then opened up the hole to bedrock, Cable fell straight in. Cable had no more elytras.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                Unfortunately for Cable he had set his spawn point in the fake base. So I spawn killed him a couple times before he escaped. Cable came back to the base later with a little bit of gear and used the ender pearl stasis chambers our team had set up to trap Novel in obsidian and kill them. Cable once again had an elytra and gear. We came up with a plan to bed trap cable to take all Novel's stuff back because Cable's spawn was still set in the fake base. We tried to lure Cable to the end so when he went back through the portal he would respawn at his bed. It worked and Cable was once again elytra-less.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                We had won. The fight was over.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                Cable put all his stuff in a chest in his base and told everyone the location in the form of a poem. Jako and I worked to solve the poem but I made it to Cable's base first and took all his stuff. I told everyone that I hadn't found Cable's stuff so they kept looking for it.
              </p>
              <p class="summary">
                As an end to the server I decided to throw all the elytras in the void. Novel helped me get Fungi's and Jako's elytra, then I killed Novel when they were<span class="strike-through">n't</span> expecting it to get their elytra. But they weren't wearing it so that failed.  I took all the elytras to the end and threw them in the void along with the dragon egg, 12 dragon heads, and 88 hearts, never to be seen again."

              "Lifesteal started out pretty well, I was teamed with TqxCollector at the beginning, and pretty early on we killed the dragon and got villagers to a little base of ours. Because of this we were pretty well off, and things were looking good. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              Later MisterCheezy, and LeStache joined my team, but unfortunately my team stopped being active pretty early on in the season, and I was left on my own. During this time most people on the server were getting along pretty well, and I did things such as selling the dragon egg to Name_Does_Stuff for 8 hearts, getting an elytra, visiting people around the server, and helping Xoliks to build the enderman farm (during which I lost my elytra, but Xoliks got me another one for the trade that I give them enchanted books). Also during this time I shared the location of my base with NovelFlyer, and Name_Does_Stuff. as I was lonely, and under the impression that I could trust them. However, this later backfired when name accidentally (I think) doxed me, and Xoliks found my location and stole a few items from me. Because of this I had to start moving bases, but before I could do so Xoliks returned to try and kill me, however after a close fight I managed to kill them, and even killed them multiple times, as they accidentally set their spawn at my base. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              After those events I moved bases, and while still on good terms with multiple people on the server, I kept the location of my new base secret, and things moved on as they had before, only now I was enemies with Xoliks. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              Fast forward a while, myself, and a large portion of the rest of the server were gathered at Nona and Jakovitch's base in some mountains near the world border, and we were all having competitions on horses just for fun, however things did not go as I expected during this gathering. After we had finished the horse competitions and a winner had been declared, I attacked Jakovitch because I was annoyed that he kept blowing a goat horn, and while fighting Jakovitch I accidentally killed Jakovitch's horse, and in retaliation he killed mine. After this there was no turning back and I ended up killing Jakovitch, however I did not steal any of his items. While I thought this was just a small petty fight, this changed the course of the server for me for the rest of the season. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              Following that event many people no longer trusted me, and a very large portion of the server, including Jakovitch, Nona, Kaladin004, A_Fungi and Name joined Xoliks team, and sold their souls to Xoliks, meaning that I now had many, many enemies on the server. After that, I went berserk and killed Name twice.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              As I was now at war, and outnumbered almost 10 to 1, I wanted to try to weaken, and maybe even cripple Xoliks' team, and I thought that the way to do this would be to find their base and kill them. And so the search began. Using things I thought I knew about their base (mostly things about the location I had heard in VC), I began to look for it. I was looking for somewhere far from spawn, near a nether portal, but not nether portal in the base, that might have a raid farm and a gunpowder farm near by, a near by village that had been used for raids, and near a mountain/meadow biome. I was almost certain that I had found around where it was, as I had found all of those things near the -3000 border, however I just couldn't quite find it, so I decided to try to purchase the coordinates of the base from A_Fungi. A_Fungi agreed, and we decided I would give them 3 hearts, and an elytra for the coordinates of the base. However, once A_Fungi told me the coordinates of their "base" I was almost certain they were lying, because it was on the opposite side of the map as where I thought it would be. When I checked the coordinates, however, I found a base there that matched screenshots I had seen, and also had Xoliks in it. (Much later in the season I learned that this was a fake, to scam me out of hearts and an elytra). I fought Xoliks, and managed to kill them, and loot the base. I thought that this had been a massive victory for me, but it wasn't quite as big of a victory as I thought, because this whole time Xoliks had another base, that I didn't know about. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              For a while things calmed down on the server, and it was relatively peaceful. After a little while of not much happening I decided that it would be fun to remove every tree on the server, and I got together with a lot of people from the server, even those on Xoliks' team, and we peacefully worked together to cut down trees. After many hours of cutting down trees, the server ceased to be active, and everyone kinda just gave up. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              After a break from the server I came back more determined than ever to do well, and the server was pretty active again.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I asked if my teammates that never really played could get online and give me some of their hearts, and a couple of them did. I also killed the Ender Dragon a few times for quite a few extra hearts. After this I amassed a total of 70 hearts, and I felt unstoppable. Little did I know, however, that I was very stoppable. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              As before, I knew I needed to find Xoliks' base, and as before I decided to purchase the coordinates of the base from one of Xoliks' teammates. I offered NovelFlyer a fully enchanted set of netherite armor, and an elytra to know the location of Xoliks' base, and they agreed that they would tell me. By this point, I was still oblivious to the fact that I had never actually found Xoliks' real base, and it was a fake. And I was about to be tricked yet again. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              And so after learning the location of what I thought was Xoliks base I began to brainstorm, and eventually came up with this plan: I would gear up with potions, XP, food, and everything I would need. I would then set up a stasis chamber for Tqx to trigger in case things went wrong. Then, I would die in the void, or have Tqx die from falling off a cliff. After that, Xoliks' team would go to fight the dragon for my heart, during which time I would sneak into their base and wait for them to come back from the end, as they would all be on no more than ten hearts, and I could easily kill them. And wow did this plan fail. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I discovered that Xoliks had another base, and I confronted Novel about this. Eventually they confessed that they had lied to me, and that base was a fake. What I still didn't know, was that it was trapped. And so my plans changed, I would no longer go with my dragon plan, instead I would just try to go there and trigger stasis chambers to kill Xoliks team, however, after scouting out their base I began to leave, but as I left Xoliks arrived and saw me leaving, so I confidently decided to follow Xoliks into the base, and try to kill them. I jumped down the hole to their base, but I wasn't met by a fight, instead I was met by a hole into the void, where I fell and lost all of my things. I respawned in Xoliks base, because I had accidentally set my spawn there the night before, and Xoliks killed me. However, even though I had broken the bed I respawned there again, and again, because it was the Shrine of Resurrection, and I am Link. After dying 4 more times Xoliks fell in the void, and left the game before they died. I took this opportunity to get an extra set of armor from my ender chest, and to try and kill other people from Xoliks team, using the stasis chambers. To my relief, this worked, and I managed to kill Novel, and get an elytra and armor from it. I thought that this was the end of the battle, and I would go on to fight more.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I went back to my base, and decided to gear up, and build some farms. One thing I didn't remember, however, was that my spawn was still set at the Shrine of Resurrection. After some grinding I decided to go to the end to heal armor. (I also killed Novel again in the end, however it turns out this was all a trick). When I went back through the end portal to get back to my base, I respawned at the shrine of resurrection, this time inside of an obsidian box, where I was killed several times. Feeling very discouraged. I left the game, still with just the slightest hope that I could log on later that night and escape from the box.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I logged on much sooner than I planned though. Only a few minutes after I left. This was because I planned on resigning, and letting Xoliks' kill me. However, Xoliks wasn't there, and my friend convinced me that I should stay on the server and keep fighting against Xoliks. And so, I punched through two obsidian blocks, and went back to my base to grind. 
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              Later that evening I messaged TqxCollector to get online to help me grind for new gear, however while we were talking we both decided we didn't feel like playing on the server anymore, and that we would jump in the void together.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              And so, we left all our gear and hearts in a chest, and wrote a poem that hinted to the location of the gear.
