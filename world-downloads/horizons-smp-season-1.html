                "Spawn was a mooshroom biome. One of the first things we built was the palace, a shopping system. Although it was hard for Xoliks to manage the whole place, they kept up. There where about like 5-6 shops to keep up with. People started making their own shops right outside the palace. Testificate_2005 made a perfect replica of an end ship and made it as a shop for elytras. There was a lot of theft throughout season one (even I did some theft). Ski and ABridgeMqster made a shop with elytra and gravel there was a lot of theft there too. We decided to have a president of the smp, so we had an election, but.... that didn't turn out very well, there was a lot of conflict. Next, Xoliks built a museum of some stuff of the past. The most major griefer showed up next, EmperorBraden. He griefed the palace and spawn and put  swastikas all over. we trolled him by trapping him in a bunch of obi then banned him. Jakovitch was also banned for being rude and stealing, so we held an auction for all of his stuff, test and ckugz fought over a trident for a while while I was trying to get Jako's base. Eventually, Jakovitch was unbanned."

              "When season 1 started there were no wars . The only disagreements were when new players got bullied. This is why when one new player joined he decided to do something about it. This new player, Schmoff and his friend Mintey Mew, sailed to an island and declared independence from the main server, making The Republic of Minoffia. Minoffia was a place where everyone could be equal and people would be protected. Minoffia never had much but there was peace between the citizens and they shared what little they had. Mintey and Schmoff, being the first citizens elected themselves dual presidents. A player named Crafter72 joined the nation and became prime minister. Xoliks, seeing Minoffia, made their own nation known as El Dorado. Xoliks invited Crafter to the new nation and he accepted. Crafter began spying on Minoffia in return for power. Eventually after stealing the Declaration of Independence from Minoffia, Crafter came out as a spy.

            <p class="summary">
              Shortly after admitting to spying El Dorado declared war. El Dorado stole but never destroyed during the war. Eventually the El Doradans stole the Minoffia national fish, Milo and threatened to kill him before Schmoff’s eyes if he didn’t surrender. Schmoff said that he would rather have a fair fight and challenged them to send their best fighter to fight him fist to fist. El Dorado over confidently sent Skeledroth who was defeated by Schmoff. The nation went back on their promise and tried to kill Schmoff and he narrowly escaped. El Dorado began plundering Minoffia and without the awareness of his superiors Crafter began burning their items. Schmoff began tunneling under El Dorado and snuck into Xoliks’ store, The Palace. Schmoff threatened to destroy the property if Xoliks did not begin peace negotiations. Xoliks complied and Schmoff asked for three things first to exile Crafter for his crimes, second to end the war and pay a small compensation, and third to create the Council of Nations and work together to make laws. El Dorado agreed to these terms and the server remained at peace until the end of the season."

            "The server was somewhat inactive in the beginning. However, when Schmoff joined the server, things changed. Schmoff wanted to be liberated from the rest of the SMP, so he created Minoffia alongside his friend Mintey_Meuw. He invited me to join his country, and that is where things started to go downhill. Xoliks disapproved of Schmoff creating his own country that could do whatever it wanted. Spawn was turned into a country, called El Dorado. El Dorado declared war, and so the first war on the server had started. Xoliks contacted me, as I was the prime minister of Minoffia and would be the perfect spy. I began doing some mild griefs, stealing and breaking buildings and farms. Xoliks gave me a maxed out netherite sword, and I was ready. I told Schmoff that I was a spy, and burned Minoffia down before his eyes. Skeldroth, Xoliks and I messed with Schmoff for a little bit. We departed to spawn, believing the war was over. But it wasn't. Schmoff and Mintey_Meuw griefed spawn and the Palace. Finally, a peace treaty was formed, and sadly for me, the main condition was that I was exiled. I left, bitter and vengeful, waiting for my chance to punish Minoffia. I found a plot to make tunnels all over the island, and while I had a lot of evidence against Schmoff, it wasn't enough. The season ended idle, with most of the heroes and villains missing."          </p>
