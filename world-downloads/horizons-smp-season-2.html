                "The Forgotten Year - While most residents of Horizon don’t remember much about this lapsed year there are some that remember a few key moments, the following text is from their recollections. As many of you know at the start of each year we all are taken to a new world to survive on. For some, it’s a simple life, tending to crops and animals and relaxing by a crackling fire. For others it’s moving about pillaging and adventuring till the end of the year, and for the rest of us it may be a mix of both. This year was no different from the others in the beginning. As always some were a little late to the start of the year, for those who were on time, well first come first serve. As more and more of us made our way into the world the more of us seemed to vanish from it. After 3 months of resource gathering and pillaging some of our first shops began to open. Some sold all types of wood, others powerful enchantments that would  increase protection or decrease damage from great heights. As the year continued and as more shops opened, something unexpected happened. A group of nation leaders banded together and created the “The Council of Nations“. But, as in many great alliances there is always one who turns on the rest, and this alliance was no different."

              "This was the best Project smp in my opinion. I had a blast playing with my friends and made many memories. I did so many things that I had not done previously in Minecraft. My greatest accomplishment on the server was probably making a raid farm. This was a little advanced for me but I finally managed to build it.  Then set up a totem farm and made some good diamonds.
